# My Examples
This folder contains examples I made for myself to learn how to use the library.

## blend_cam_depth.py
This example shows how to blend the depth map with the camera image.

## blend_cam_depth_spatialLocation.py
This example shows how to blend the depth map with the camera image and also show the spatial location of the depth map in a grid

## blend_cam_depth_spatialLocation_lite.py
This example shows how to blend the depth map with the camera image and also show the spatial location of the depth map in a grid. This example works better on OAK D lite.

## Camera_with_edge.py
This example shows how to use the edge detection model with the camera.

## neural_network_yolov8.py
This example shows how to use the YOLOv8 model on the OAK D camera.

## spatial_nerual_network_yolov8.py
This example shows how to use the YOLOv8 model on the OAK D camera and also show the spatial location of the the detected objects in a grid.

## start and dispaly camera.py
This example shows how to start the camera and display the camera image.

## stereo_basics.py
This example shows how to use the stereo depth model on the OAK D camera.

## stereo_good_filter.py
This example shows how to use the stereo depth model on the OAK D camera and also apply a filter to the depth map to make it look better.

## stereo_good_filter_on_host.py
This example shows how to use the stereo depth model on the OAK D camera and also apply a filter to the depth map to make it look better. This example works better on OAK D lite and does some filtering on the host computer.

## stereo_multi_roi_closet.py
Returns the region of interest that is closest to the camera.

## stereo_multi_roi.py
Show multiple regions of interest on the depth map.

## stereo_with_rgb.py
Show stereo and rgb frames side by side.

## Track yolo detection (Not done yet)
This example shows how to use the YOLOv8 model on the OAK D camera and also show the spatial location of the the detected objects in a grid. This example also tracks the detected objects and shows the tracking id on the screen.
